# MatrixMultiply

Hello All,

The code files in the repository are from my independant study Jr. year at the University of Colorado. I am studying parallel computing using MPI under professor John Evans.

Below is a breif summary of each .c file:

matrixFix - Holds the matrix class I am using as well as the matrix multiplication functions

mainFix - A test main for validating that my matrixFix functions work as desired

distributedPara - This program uses multiple processes to solve the matrix multiplication problem using blocking sockets

distParaAsync - A copy of distributedPara with non-blocking sockets

slaveMaster - A slave master implementation using a non - blocking main and blocking slaves

slaveMaster2 - A slave master implementation using non-blocking slaves and a non-blocking master

If you have any questions, contact me at seth.zegelstein@colorado.edu
Thanks!!
